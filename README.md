# Heart Disease Classification

## 📌 Overview
This project builds a **binary classification model** to determine whether a person is likely to have heart disease based on clinical and demographic features.  
The goal is to apply machine learning techniques on a medical dataset and evaluate multiple models to identify the best-performing one.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models
The notebook includes training and evaluation of the following ML algorithms:

- **Random Forest**  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
- **Decision Tree**  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Naive Bayes**  

The models are compared using **accuracy** to identify the best-performing classifier.

## 📝 Steps Performed in the Project

- Loaded and explored the dataset  
- Analyzed target variable distribution  
- Visualized numeric features and correlations  
- Split dataset into features and target  
- Trained multiple ML models  
- Evaluated models and compared accuracies
